        <h1>Hello! My name is Trishu Patel.</h1>
        <p>
          I am second year college student (but fourth year in credits) studying computer science at the
          University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a young age, I have been fascinated by the ways computers are
          able to solve complex problem with simple logic. Learning how to
          harness such a powerful tool to create something awesome has always
          been a dream of mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have just started my journey into the vast field of computer science
          and am excited to see what the future holds.
