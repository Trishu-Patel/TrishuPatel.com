        I am a sophomore (but a senior in credits) studying computer science at
        the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I am also minoring in business
        administration and mathematics.

        From a young age, I have been fascinated by the ways computers are
        able to solve complex problem with simple logic. Learning how to
        harness such a powerful tool to create something awesome has always
        been a dream of mine.
